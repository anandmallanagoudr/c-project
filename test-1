git pull --> it will  bring the changes from central repo and merges to local repo and to call the latest changes we use pull
git push --> if we want to add the files from our locat repo to central repo we use git push
git fetch --> bringing the latest changes from remote-repo tolocat repo so that the changes will nit autometically merge with local repo .....
